     * 8/23/2010 JRC - This test has been moved to Ignore.  The caching client
     * was set to return status code 411 on a missing content-length header when
     * a request had a body.  It seems that somewhere deeper in the client stack
     * this header is added automatically for us - so the caching client shouldn't
     * specifically be worried about this requirement.
