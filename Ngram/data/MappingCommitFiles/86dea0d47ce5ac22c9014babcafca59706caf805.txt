         // We now have a manager with an open connection in it's pool.
        // We drop all potential hard reference to the manager and check
        // whether it is GCed. Internal references might prevent that
        // if set up incorrectly.
        // Note that we still keep references to the connection wrapper
        // we got from the manager, directly as well as in the request
        // and in the context. The manager will be GCed only if the
        // connection wrapper is truly detached.
